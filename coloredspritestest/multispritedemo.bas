   ;  Example Program
   ;
   ;  Multisprite: 9 Objects with Coordinates
   ;
   ;
   ;  By Duane Alan Hahn (Random Terrain) using hints, tips,
   ;  code snippets, and more from AtariAge members such as
   ;  batari, SeaGtGruff, RevEng, Robert M, Atarius Maximus,
   ;  jrok, Nukey Shay, supercat, and GroovyBee.
   ;
   ;  Score coordinate code provided by bogax.
   ;
   ;```````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
   ;
   ;  Instructions
   ;  
   ;  There are 6 sprites (player0 at the top, down to player5 at
   ;  the bottom), 2 missiles (missile0 above missile1) and 1 ball
   ;  on the screen. Hold down the fire button and press the
   ;  joystick up or down to select an object. Hold down the fire
   ;  button and move the joystick left or right to change the size
   ;  of the currently selected object.
   ;  
   ;  To move the currently selected object, release the fire
   ;  button and press the joystick in any direction.
   ;

   ;  Variable aliases go here (DIMs).
   ;
   ;  You can have more than one alias for each variable.
   ;  If you use different aliases for bit operations,
   ;  it's easier to understand and remember what they do.
   ;
   ;  I start variable aliases with one underscore so I won't
   ;  have to worry that I might be using bB keywords by mistake.
   ;  I also start labels with two underscores for the same
   ;  reason. The second underscore also makes labels stand out 
   ;  so I can tell at a glance that they are labels and not
   ;  variables.
   ;
   ;  Use bit operations any time you need a simple off/on
   ;  variable. One variable essentially becomes 8 smaller
   ;  variables when you use bit operations.
   ;
   ;  I start my bit aliases with "_Bit" then follow that
   ;  with the bit number from 0 to 7, then another underscore
   ;  and the name. Example: _Bit0_Reset_Restrainer 
   ;
